I'm the only one who works on this modification, so updates will depend on when I have time
Thank you for your understanding

The entire modification will be based on the history of Europe that I invented

My plans for this modification are as follows:
1.building Focus trees for all "playable" countries
2.Addition of new playable countries e.g
NGR - New German
NJP - New Japan
OTT - Ottoman Empire
CSA - Confederate States of America
3.New Events
4.Alternative history, among others 
- the Swedish state and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth did not fight with each other and did not break up
- World War I never took place, and the first European war in 1898-1916 took place instead
- China, Russia and Mongolia created the "Asian Pact" in 1920
- Rzeczpospolita became Poland under the influence of the vote, in which Lithuania returned to the map, and soon afterwards the eastern part of Poland, once under the control of Lithuania, rebelled and Poland broke up
- and many more that will be described in the game
5.Scenarios are planned:
- 1895 Before the First European War
- 1898, the first European war
- 1916, the end of the First European War
- 1915, 4th Asian war
- 1930, Time before the Second World War (the first war took place in 1830)
- 1935. Hitler's plan
- 1936. Communist revolution in Asia
- more in the future
Initially, I want to deal only with scenarios from 1935 and 1936, because the following dates require a new "technology tree" and I still do not know how to do it (because this is my first modification)

if someone has an idea and fits the concept of modification, it can appear in it
